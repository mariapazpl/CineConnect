<p>The link above contains the Figma high-fidelity prototype for my project CineConnect.</p>

Within this folder contains various elements of the design process including competitive auditing, creation of personas, wireframes, user research and testing, etc.

The purpose of this project was to develop a movie app in Figma to streamline the process for ticket purchase and express check-in. I incorporated KPIs (i.e. system usability scale) and unmoderated usability studies to create low and high-fidelity prototypes. After conducting user research I implemented a new 'Invite Friends' feature which allows users to send a link to their friends to purchase their tickets while keeping the seats together.
